  Filled 4 tires on 1 charge","Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2023",,"Product inflated tires well and adapters fit perfectly for some exercise balls and soccer balls we had as well. The overall inflation speed totaled about 3-4 minutes for 5psi on a tire near capacity, but given the convenience it is by no means an issue for me. The design is very simple to understand and the value seems reasonable given the time it saves me pumping tires elsewhere. The durability hasn’t been tested long enough yet at this point but it otherwise got 8 tires maxed by 5 psi each on a single charge in about 20 minutes and it’s charging speed after was fine, albeit I didn’t time that since I won’t need it again for a bit.",

  Great!","Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2025",No,"Pros: - Portable - Easy to Use - Comes with charging cable Cons: - Noisy (though I do not have another brand to compare it to, maybe they are all this noisy) - Battery went from green to yellow very fast (after 2 tires). I haven't tried using it for 2 cars at a time to see if it has enough battery for 8 tires. One car it has enough, and then I charge it up again after. So far it has enough battery for what I need out of it. I am pleased that I do not have to worry about going to a gas station to put in air in my tires now. A lot of stations charge or if they turn it on for free for you it doesn't last long and you keep having to go to them to turn it back on. My 2013 Kia Optima tends to lose air pressure easily when the weather is cold so this has given me a peace of mind knowing I have this in case. Also worked great for my sister's new 2024 Kia Sportage. I think it was worth the money spent.",4 people found this helpful

 Overall this work very well for what it is, a portable air pump for a car without the need to use a big air tank or paying so much for gas station pumps that seem to never work very well. The sensors were very accurate and inflate my tire that I had problems with. Although you may want to use a bigger pump for a flat tire. Otherwise, this should be an essential item for everyone.",

,Brett L.,4.0 out of 5 stars, 4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2021",,"Review PROS: Focus is on the amount of air being moved versus battery capacity. It added 3 PSI to all 4 of my my P235/55R19 tires for my hybrid Tucson in about 6 - 7 minutes total as the airflow is a fast 35 LPM. It has a nice long air hose that is almost 20 inches and it is the screw type Schrader valve which I've been looking for. I have large hands and I am a Sr. Citizen. By the time I find the Schrader valve on the tire it's buried inside the fancy wheel rims that come with the SUV. So I prefer the screw on type as I lose less air than I do with the clip on type. I am not enamored with the clip on type which is using a plastic lock and I really question how long that will work and not break. This is why I bought this model versus the newer model that actually has 45LPM and it comes with a storage case for the same price as I paid for this model. The manufacturer claims 40 minutes continuous battery use which is more than enough to fill ~ 20 tires but that's based on smaller tire dimensions, usually they are quoting 16 or 17-in width tires versus my 19-in. Many of my retired friends feel the same way as it's much easier for us to deal with the screw on Schrader valve than it is the press on lock type hose fitting. If the new model had the screw on type I would have bought that as it would have saved me some money but that's how strongly I feel about having the screw on type air hose. With the reduced amperage on the battery it makes it much lighter and also smaller. I found the case that holds all the fittings in the air hose in a much smaller dimension case that easily fits into my Tucson or RAV 4 glove boxes. It has a bag to hold all the cords and attachments. It has strong air transfer claiming 4X faster air transfer which is the key thing. (Who needs four hours of continuous battery capacity?? At that point I'll pull out my small air compressor and get it all done < half that time)! I attached a photo of the new case versus the old case I procured for a different model that had a 25,000 aMh battery so that was the case that fit for that type of unit The display is bright and pretty intuitive settings on thev AP1001. I have updated my review to five stars for two reasons: I used this on a recent road trip to Oregon and California. I aired up my tires four times and the battery was still charged up enough to NOT be in the red. Also the customer service as mentioned by a few people is very good. I called to register this product for the warranty which is 18 months and they actually upgraded to 2 years which is one of the better warranties out there. CONS: the new model uses the press on type connector versus the screw on air hose. Plus the new model is the same price as the old model with better performance and an includes a storage case with it. It would also be nice to come with the cigarette lighter extension so you had dual power as many of the other competing models do but not that big of a deal to me.",

The charging port was obviously not as constructed but I discovered I could charge anyways so I kept it. I have a bent rim which leaks 6psi every 7-10 days. This inflator gets my tire from 28 to 34 psi in under 2 minutes. My car's tire pressure sensors say exactly what this inflator does so its accurate. Fits in my console. Charges within an hour. I've pumped all four tires 6x each a few psi before the internal battery even suggested needing a recharge. What a great value. Even helped a stranded motorist do her tire on the roadside. The light I havent used but knowing its there is a plus.,

 I've used it for car tires, lawn mower tires and bike tires. The fact that you can simply set the PSI and let it run is extremely convenient and it has a wide range of pressure to use.
 

 We ended up using this one so much that we purchased a separate one to keep in a vehicle.
 

 I literally just used this today while a family member was over and had one tire low on air. They asked what I was using and will probably purchase one as well when they saw how easy it was to operate.

It's super easy to operate and it's nice knowing the pressure is spot on.
 

 I imagine it would require an entire single charge to inflate a single tire from flat.
 

 I have only two nitpicks: One concerns the device and one has nothing to do with the device.
 

 1. I've never run across a device that REQUIRED a USB-A to USB-C cable before. You can use any old wall USB-A wall adapter if needed, but this device will NOT charge with a USB-C to USB-C cable. Weird. Good thing I've got a couple super long A-C cables I can use in place of the super short one that came in the box.
 

 2. The issue that has nothing to with the device ... My wheels are aftermarket and the valve stem is shrouded by the design just enough to make screwing on the shrader adaptor a pain the ass.
 

 Too early to ascertain the Airmoto's longevity, but after one use, I'm impressed.",

I started the Airmoto from a full charge. My lowest tire showed it had 16 psi in it on my device. I aired that tire completely to 34 psi. The battery light turned from green to orange. I air a 2nd tire from 24 psi to 34, and then a 3rd tire from 26 psi to 34 before the battery light began to flash red. The device ran out of battery life right after airing my 3rd tire. That is impressive considering the lowest psi started from 16. This device appears to be able to inflate a fully deflated tire to almost full before its battery goes medium. It will perform optimally if all 4 tires are only slightly low on air. I'm impressed with the Airmoto. I would highly recommend this product.",

,Joel,5.0 out of 5 stars,,,,"Review PROS: Focus is on the amount of air being moved versus battery capacity. It added 3 PSI to all 4 of my my P235/55R19 tires for my hybrid Tucson in about 6 - 7 minutes total as the airflow is a fast 35 LPM. It has a nice long air hose that is almost 20 inches and it is the screw type Schrader valve which I've been looking for. I have large hands and I am a Sr. Citizen. By the time I find the Schrader valve on the tire it's buried inside the fancy wheel rims that come with the SUV. So I prefer the screw on type as I lose less air than I do with the clip on type. I am not enamored with the clip on type which is using a plastic lock and I really question how long that will work and not break. This is why I bought this model versus the newer model that actually has 45LPM and it comes with a storage case for the same price as I paid for this model. The manufacturer claims 40 minutes continuous battery use which is more than enough to fill ~ 20 tires but that's based on smaller tire dimensions, usually they are quoting 16 or 17-in width tires versus my 19-in. Many of my retired friends feel the same way as it's much easier for us to deal with the screw on Schrader valve than it is the press on lock type hose fitting. If the new model had the screw on type I would have bought that as it would have saved me some money but that's how strongly I feel about having the screw on type air hose. With the reduced amperage on the battery it makes it much lighter and also smaller. I found the case that holds all the fittings in the air hose in a much smaller dimension case that easily fits into my Tucson or RAV 4 glove boxes. It has a bag to hold all the cords and attachments. It has strong air transfer claiming 4X faster air transfer which is the key thing. (Who needs four hours of continuous battery capacity?? At that point I'll pull out my small air compressor and get it all done < half that time)! I attached a photo of the new case versus the old case I procured for a different model that had a 25,000 aMh battery so that was the case that fit for that type of unit The display is bright and pretty intuitive settings on thev AP1001. I have updated my review to five stars for two reasons: I used this on a recent road trip to Oregon and California. I aired up my tires four times and the battery was still charged up enough to NOT be in the red. Also the customer service as mentioned by a few people is very good. I called to register this product for the warranty which is 18 months and they actually upgraded to 2 years which is one of the better warranties out there. CONS: the new model uses the press on type connector versus the screw on air hose. Plus the new model is the same price as the old model with better performance and an includes a storage case with it. It would also be nice to come with the cigarette lighter extension so you had dual power as many of the other competing models do but not that big of a deal to me.",

,ERCW,5.0 out of 5 stars, 5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2019",,"The Airmoto Tire Inflator Portable Air Compressor is a handy and efficient solution for keeping your car tires properly inflated, especially when you're on the go. Whether you're on a long road trip or just need a quick top-up after noticing a slow leak, this compact device offers a lot of convenience for such a small package.
 

 Design and Build: The first thing you'll notice about the Airmoto Inflator is its compact and portable design. At just about the size of a water bottle, it’s easy to stash in your car's glove compartment, trunk, or even under the seat without taking up much space. The build feels solid for its size, with a durable plastic exterior that can handle some bumps and scrapes.
 

 Ease of Use: Using the Airmoto is straightforward. It comes with an easy-to-read LED display that shows the current tire pressure and allows you to set your desired pressure. The built-in preset options for various tire types (like car, bike, or ball) make it even more user-friendly. The hose is long enough to reach all four tires without feeling like you’re stretched too thin. There’s also a nice touch with the built-in LED light, making it easier to use at night or in low-light conditions.
 

 Performance: When it comes to performance, the Airmoto Tire Inflator delivers. It has a maximum pressure of 150 PSI, which is more than sufficient for most car tires, bike tires, and other inflatables like balls or air mattresses. Inflation speed is decent – it can take a few minutes to fully inflate a car tire from a low PSI, but it’s efficient enough for emergency situations. It’s not as fast as larger, more powerful compressors, but for a portable, battery-operated device, it’s more than acceptable.
 

 Portability: One of the standout features of the Airmoto is its portability. Unlike many other air compressors that require a car's power outlet, this unit is rechargeable via USB-C, so you can charge it at home or even using a portable power bank. The fact that it doesn’t need to be plugged into your vehicle makes it ideal for situations where you’re away from home or need to top off a tire while parked on the side of the road.
 

 Battery Life: The rechargeable battery is a bit of a mixed bag. While it holds a charge long enough to inflate one or two tires, don’t expect to run through a full set of four tires before needing a recharge. It’s great for quick, emergency use, but you’ll need to plan ahead for longer inflation tasks.
 

 Accuracy and Reliability: The built-in pressure gauge is accurate enough for everyday use, though it may differ slightly from high-end, professional gauges. For the average driver, it provides reliable readings, and the automatic shutoff feature when the desired pressure is reached is a huge plus – no need to worry about over-inflating.
 

 Conclusion: Overall, the Airmoto Tire Inflator is a solid, portable solution for tire inflation in a pinch. It excels in ease of use, portability, and convenience, making it a great addition to your car emergency kit. While it may not replace a full-size air compressor for heavy-duty or frequent use, it’s perfect for the average driver who needs a reliable tool for occasional tire inflation or other inflation tasks.
 

 Pros:
 

 Compact, portable design
 Easy-to-read LED display and preset options
 USB-C rechargeable, no need for a car power outlet
 Built-in LED light for nighttime use
 Accurate pressure readings and automatic shutoff
 Cons:
 

 Slower inflation compared to larger compressors
 Battery life could be improved for multiple tires
 Not as suitable for frequent or heavy-duty use
 Final Verdict: If you're looking for a convenient, easy-to-use air compressor for occasional tire inflation, the Airmoto Tire Inflator is a great choice. Its compact size, ease of use, and portability make it an excellent tool for road trips, emergencies, or everyday maintenance. Just be aware that it’s not designed for heavy, continuous use, but for the casual user, it’s a very practical solution.",

,Perrocafe,5.0 out of 5 stars,,,,I highly recommend this for older vehicles without advanced TPMS.,
,Justin,5.0 out of 5 stars,,,,"Review PROS: Focus is on the amount of air being moved versus battery capacity. It added 3 PSI to all 4 of my my P235/55R19 tires for my hybrid Tucson in about 6 - 7 minutes total as the airflow is a fast 35 LPM. It has a nice long air hose that is almost 20 inches and it is the screw type Schrader valve which I've been looking for. I have large hands and I am a Sr. Citizen. By the time I find the Schrader valve on the tire it's buried inside the fancy wheel rims that come with the SUV. So I prefer the screw on type as I lose less air than I do with the clip on type. I am not enamored with the clip on type which is using a plastic lock and I really question how long that will work and not break. This is why I bought this model versus the newer model that actually has 45LPM and it comes with a storage case for the same price as I paid for this model. The manufacturer claims 40 minutes continuous battery use which is more than enough to fill ~ 20 tires but that's based on smaller tire dimensions, usually they are quoting 16 or 17-in width tires versus my 19-in. Many of my retired friends feel the same way as it's much easier for us to deal with the screw on Schrader valve than it is the press on lock type hose fitting. If the new model had the screw on type I would have bought that as it would have saved me some money but that's how strongly I feel about having the screw on type air hose. With the reduced amperage on the battery it makes it much lighter and also smaller. I found the case that holds all the fittings in the air hose in a much smaller dimension case that easily fits into my Tucson or RAV 4 glove boxes. It has a bag to hold all the cords and attachments. It has strong air transfer claiming 4X faster air transfer which is the key thing. (Who needs four hours of continuous battery capacity?? At that point I'll pull out my small air compressor and get it all done < half that time)! I attached a photo of the new case versus the old case I procured for a different model that had a 25,000 aMh battery so that was the case that fit for that type of unit The display is bright and pretty intuitive settings on thev AP1001. I have updated my review to five stars for two reasons: I used this on a recent road trip to Oregon and California. I aired up my tires four times and the battery was still charged up enough to NOT be in the red. Also the customer service as mentioned by a few people is very good. I called to register this product for the warranty which is 18 months and they actually upgraded to 2 years which is one of the better warranties out there.
 

 CONS: the new model uses the press on type connector versus the screw on air hose. Plus the new model is the same price as the old model with better performance and an includes a storage case with it. It would also be nice to come with the cigarette lighter extension so you had dual power as many of the other competing models do but not that big of a deal to me.",

I also drained it completely and it didn’t take it too long to charge also. The auto shut off worked like it should.

I haven't tried using it for 2 cars at a time to see if it has enough battery for 8 tires. One car it has enough, and then I charge it up again after. So far it has enough battery for what I need out of it. I am pleased that I do not have to worry about going to a gas station to put in air in my tires now. A lot of stations charge or if they turn it on for free for you it doesn't last long and you keep having to go to them to turn it back on. My 2013 Kia Optima tends to lose air pressure easily when the weather is cold so this has given me a peace of mind knowing I have this in case.

 This worked great right out of the box. My SUV has a tire that has a very slow leak, like only needs airing up every 3 months slow. But I hate seeing that low tire signal on my dash and hate having to find a gas station when I’m traveling because not all have air pumps.
 

 This was louder than I expected but not bad. It was clearly labeled as to what parts would get hot. I tested the tire before hooking it up and set the machine to stop a few psi before that so I could be sure. And it measured current psi correctly, as well as stopped when it reached the set limit.
 

 I checked with a manual tire gauge after and it was perfect!

This happens especially when the temperature drops suddenly, and I don't have time to stop by an oil change venue to have the tire pressure fixed. And the air pressure machines at the gas stations are ridiculously hard to use. This Airmoto device, on the other hand, was a breeze! A huge thank you to Chad Brown's video on the site for showing me how to use it. After watching that, I was able to easily set up the machine on my car tires, and it easily pumped them up from 26psi to 30psi - what my car requires. I had the device set on car and lowered the psi from the automatic 35psi to 30psi. It took about 10 minutes to pump up all 4 tires. The battery was green when I started, and there was plenty of power left when I finished. The device is noisy, and it takes a few minutes, but it's not that noisy, and it was only a few minutes.

,Ashley,5.0 out of 5 stars, 5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2019",,"Let's be honest, I'm usually the last person to jump on a 'recommended at a discounted price' bandwagon. But this time? Oh, boy, am I singing a different tune. Turns out, this little gadget was a cosmic intervention disguised as a bargain.
 

 The very day it arrived, my car decided to throw a hissy fit, with my rear driver's side tire slowly deflating like a sad balloon. A few days later, a tire shop confirmed my suspicions – a rogue screw had decided to take up residence in my rubber. So, this nifty little air pump became my knight in shining… plastic?
 

 Now, it's not going to inflate a semi-truck tire in 30 seconds, and it's not going to win any power-lifting contests. But it's surprisingly efficient. It gets the job done without making you feel like you're waiting for paint to dry. And the sheer number of attachments? It's like a Swiss Army knife for air.
 

 The rechargeable aspect is a game-changer. No more fumbling with cords or searching for an outlet in the middle of nowhere. Plus, it's so easy to use, even I, a person who once struggled to assemble a bookshelf, could operate it without a manual.
 

 What I truly appreciate is the automatic shut-off feature. Set the desired PSI, press the button, and walk away. It's like having a tiny, responsible robot handling your tire inflation needs. I sincerely hope I don't have to use it often, but knowing it's there, ready to save the day, gives me a sense of… well, a sense of not being stranded with a flat tire. It fits in my glove box, waiting for the next opportunity. That's a good feeling. This discounted suggestion? It's officially a hero in my book.",

There's a bonus function that you can use it as a flashlight which is really really bright because of the big LED on top of it. So now I can get rid of my small tire pump and flashlight I used to keep in my trunk. Only thing that I didn't prefer is that even though it's small, it's actually a pretty decent amount of weight so if it was lighter that would be better, but I read somewhere that it's heavy because of the large battery capacity so I guess that's a pretty good trade-off in my opinion.",

,Jiaojiao,5.0 out of 5 stars,,,,"Review PROS: Focus is on the amount of air being moved versus battery capacity. It added 3 PSI to all 4 of my my P235/55R19 tires for my hybrid Tucson in about 6 - 7 minutes total as the airflow is a fast 35 LPM. It has a nice long air hose that is almost 20 inches and it is the screw type Schrader valve which I've been looking for. I have large hands and I am a Sr. Citizen. By the time I find the Schrader valve on the tire it's buried inside the fancy wheel rims that come with the SUV. So I prefer the screw on type as I lose less air than I do with the clip on type. I am not enamored with the clip on type which is using a plastic lock and I really question how long that will work and not break. This is why I bought this model versus the newer model that actually has 45LPM and it comes with a storage case for the same price as I paid for this model. The manufacturer claims 40 minutes continuous battery use which is more than enough to fill ~ 20 tires but that's based on smaller tire dimensions, usually they are quoting 16 or 17-in width tires versus my 19-in. Many of my retired friends feel the same way as it's much easier for us to deal with the screw on Schrader valve than it is the press on lock type hose fitting. If the new model had the screw on type I would have bought that as it would have saved me some money but that's how strongly I feel about having the screw on type air hose. With the reduced amperage on the battery it makes it much lighter and also smaller. I found the case that holds all the fittings in the air hose in a much smaller dimension case that easily fits into my Tucson or RAV 4 glove boxes. It has a bag to hold all the cords and attachments. It has strong air transfer claiming 4X faster air transfer which is the key thing. (Who needs four hours of continuous battery capacity?? At that point I'll pull out my small air compressor and get it all done < half that time)! I attached a photo of the new case versus the old case I procured for a different model that had a 25,000 aMh battery so that was the case that fit for that type of unit The display is bright and pretty intuitive settings on thev AP1001. I have updated my review to five stars for two reasons: I used this on a recent road trip to Oregon and California. I aired up my tires four times and the battery was still charged up enough to NOT be in the red. Also the customer service as mentioned by a few people is very good. I called to register this product for the warranty which is 18 months and they actually upgraded to 2 years which is one of the better warranties out there. CONS: the new model uses the press on type connector versus the screw on air hose. Plus the new model is the same price as the old model with better performance and an includes a storage case with it. It would also be nice to come with the cigarette lighter extension so you had dual power as many of the other competing models do but not that big of a deal to me.",

 It has a very accurate and easy-to-read digital gauge, and I love that you can preset the desired pressure – the inflator automatically stops when it reaches that level, preventing overinflation. It is compact, lightweight and perfect to carry in the car or even in your backpack if you go on a motorcycle or bike.

,Noah,5.0 out of 5 stars, 5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2021",,"I have used a regular compressor for everything and still do for power tools but this tool is so much more efficient for what it is made for. Not having a shop where I have a compressor running all the time meant pulling it out of storage, plugging it in, waiting for the pressure to build, dragging the hose to where I needed it, applying it to the tire, stopping to check where in the process I was, either applying more air or deflating after finding I had over inflated and repeating this process as needed. With this tool I simply set the desired pressure (It already is set for three standards and a fourth one you can customize) and hook it up. If the preset is not what you want then you can change it and it’s ready from then until you need to change it again. Once you connect it and turn it on, the display will tell you what pressure will be applied and what the current pressure is. If it is under pleasured it will automatically begin pumping air until the desired pressure is achieved and then stop. When you have completed the process the size is small enough to store in your glove box and is ready for the next time. The battery indicator gives you plenty of notice of when to recharge but just in case, most newer cars have USB ports and you can use these to charge it also. Needless to say, I am completely sold on this product and think you will be also.",

,MGS,5.0 out of 5 stars, 5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2019",,"This winter, I have spent way too much time and money putting air in our cars' tires. Each time this has to be done, I've gone to the local gas station, fiddled with the stupid air compressor in the freezing weather. Hands numb, I'd put some air in and then use my gauge to try and figure out how much more was needed. Again and again and again. Each week as the temps dropped, this was my routine. Sometimes the air compressor wasn't available, sometimes it didn't work. Every time it was almost impossible to accurately figure out how much air was needed.
 

 AND THAT IS WAS THE PAST because this little portable air compressor is AWESOME.
 

 It is basically a battery (which can also be used to charge your phone in an emergency) with an air compressor. But the best part is that you can easily set it to your desired air pressure, connect it to your tires, and it does all the work! It will fill the tire to the desired air pressure and then stop. No fumbling with gauges and award compressor hoses.
 

 Now, this is basically a giant battery, so if you leave it in your car in the cold, it is going to drain pretty fast. So be aware of that.
 

 Charging the unit in my house was pretty fast. It came mostly charged and I topped it off to 100%. Then I went out and did a total of 8 tires and the battery had barely budged. So clearly this can do quite a bit of work on a single charge.
 

 Overall, this is a fantastic buy and we are going to be getting one for each car we have and charging it regularly. Totally worth every penny.",

 ORIGINAL - Don't count on this thing to fill a flat tire. I increased two tires from 30psi to 40psi...it took each tire about 5 minutes and the battery indicator was red after the second tire. It started with a fully charged battery. This thing will not give you 40 min of continuous run time and I highly doubt it will inflate a flat tire. It takes about 2 hours to fully charge by USB. This thing is OK to inflate 1 or 2 low tires if you're on a road trip...and that's about it.

,Joshua,5.0 out of 5 stars, 5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2021",,"Review PROS: Focus is on the amount of air being moved versus battery capacity. It added 3 PSI to all 4 of my my P235/55R19 tires for my hybrid Tucson in about 6 - 7 minutes total as the airflow is a fast 35 LPM. It has a nice long air hose that is almost 20 inches and it is the screw type Schrader valve which I've been looking for. I have large hands and I am a Sr. Citizen. By the time I find the Schrader valve on the tire it's buried inside the fancy wheel rims that come with the SUV. So I prefer the screw on type as I lose less air than I do with the clip on type. I am not enamored with the clip on type which is using a plastic lock and I really question how long that will work and not break. This is why I bought this model versus the newer model that actually has 45LPM and it comes with a storage case for the same price as I paid for this model. The manufacturer claims 40 minutes continuous battery use which is more than enough to fill ~ 20 tires but that's based on smaller tire dimensions, usually they are quoting 16 or 17-in width tires versus my 19-in. Many of my retired friends feel the same way as it's much easier for us to deal with the screw on Schrader valve than it is the press on lock type hose fitting. If the new model had the screw on type I would have bought that as it would have saved me some money but that's how strongly I feel about having the screw on type air hose. With the reduced amperage on the battery it makes it much lighter and also smaller. I found the case that holds all the fittings in the air hose in a much smaller dimension case that easily fits into my Tucson or RAV 4 glove boxes. It has a bag to hold all the cords and attachments. It has strong air transfer claiming 4X faster air transfer which is the key thing. (Who needs four hours of continuous battery capacity?? At that point I'll pull out my small air compressor and get it all done < half that time)! I attached a photo of the new case versus the old case I procured for a different model that had a 25,000 aMh battery so that was the case that fit for that type of unit The display is bright and pretty intuitive settings on thev AP1001. I have updated my review to five stars for two reasons: I used this on a recent road trip to Oregon and California. I aired up my tires four times and the battery was still charged up enough to NOT be in the red. Also the customer service as mentioned by a few people is very good. I called to register this product for the warranty which is 18 months and they actually upgraded to 2 years which is one of the better warranties out there. CONS: the new model uses the press on type connector versus the screw on air hose. Plus the new model is the same price as the old model with better performance and an includes a storage case with it. It would also be nice to come with the cigarette lighter extension so you had dual power as many of the other competing models do but not that big of a deal to me.",

,Donna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect just in time,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2022",,"I recently purchased the MODARI Tire Inflator, and it has quickly become an essential part of my travel gear! This portable air compressor is a game-changer for road trips, daily maintenance, and emergencies.
 

 First off, the inflation speed is impressive. It took just about a minute to top up my car tire from 30PSI to 36PSI, which is perfect when you're in a hurry. The 22,000RPM motor delivers strong airflow, and the cooling technology ensures it doesn’t overheat even during extended use.
 

 Battery life is another standout feature. With its 7800mAh battery, I can inflate multiple tires on a single charge without worrying about frequent recharging. The power efficiency is noticeably better than other inflators I’ve used.
 

 The preset modes for cars, motorcycles, bikes, and balls make it super convenient, and the custom mode allows for precise adjustments. The LED screen is bright and easy to read, even under sunlight. I also love the auto shut-off feature, which prevents over-inflation and ensures safety.
 

 Another great touch is its multi-functionality. Not only is it an excellent tire inflator, but it also serves as a power bank and emergency flashlight—perfect for camping trips or unexpected roadside situations.
 

 Overall, the MODARI Tire Inflator is reliable, fast, and packed with useful features. It saves time and effort compared to visiting a gas station, and its compact design makes it easy to store in the car. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a high-quality, portable air compressor!",

The functionality of this air compressor is amazing! The size, speed of inflating tires, and heat level is great. I have no complaints! I love the compact size so you can literally carry it in your backpack, the luggage dept on motorcycles, or in the trunk of your vehicles. The design is very sleek and all the components are very nice as well. Using this in rainy weather has not deterred it either, it is very durable in all types of weather.",

,Kenneth,4.0 out of 5 stars, 4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2021",,"I honestly didn’t expect to love a tire inflator this much—but here we are! Just yesterday, I found myself with a flat tire in the middle of nowhere. Normally that would mean calling roadside assistance or anyone to help, but thanks to this little powerhouse, I was back on the road in minutes. And I did it by myself!
 

 It was so easy to use—just plug it in, set the pressure, and let it do its thing. The digital display is super clear, and the automatic shut-off means I never have to worry about overinflating. What really surprised me is how compact it is. It barely takes up any space in my trunk, which is a huge plus since I like to keep things minimal.
 

 I absolutely sure I use it regularly just to top off my tires and even inflate bike tires.
 I just regrated not to buy it sooner.
 It is reliable, fast, and easy to use—this inflator has seriously made my life easier.
 

 If you drive, you need one of these. I feel so much more prepared now. Total game changer!",

I used on 8 tires that were a few lbs down. (Light came on) took it with us on a road trip to Tampa. Fixed a flat for my daughter. It was completely flat. After 6 months it still showed charged I decided to recharge it. It took 2 hours to charge and was blinking on the yellow. So I would assume when it starts to drop the lights to charge immediately. I would imagine it goes down really quick. Something to keep an eye on. It takes about 5 minutes to air up a flat. So 20 minutes for 4 flat tires. Probably faster if off the car.
 I would definitely recommend this item to anyone. Very easy to use.

However, with the pump and flexible hose, I am able to screw the pump and air valve together, read the pressure, and then fill with air. I hope it lasts because I really like the pump.

,Abbie Parsons,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2023",,"I recently purchased this portable air compressor and it has already proven to be a smart investment.
 

 The size is compact and easy to store in the car, yet it delivers impressive power. The 160 PSI capacity inflates car tires quickly and efficiently — much faster than I expected for a device this size.
 

 One of my favorite features is the digital display and preset pressure function. You can easily set your desired PSI, and it automatically stops when it reaches the target, so there’s no guesswork involved.
 

 Wireless operation and built-in rechargeable battery make it incredibly convenient. No need to fumble with cables or look for a power outlet. Perfect for roadside emergencies or quick top-ups at home.
 

 It also comes with multiple nozzles, so you can use it for bike tires, balls, and even inflatable pool toys. Very versatile!
 

 If you drive frequently or want to be prepared for flat tire situations, this portable inflator is a must-have. Small investment for big peace of mind.",

It was straightforward to connect and use. it properly shut off when each tire reached the target pressure. The inflation cable (which is labelled ""Hot"") did indeed get quite hot by the time all four tires were done, but the connection nut was not hot and as long as I was careful not to hold the cable it was fine.
 

 As I expected, the speed of inflation was significantly slower than a typical high pressure machine at a gas station. It took about 15 minutes to do the four tires. But for a small portable unit that can be kept charged in the car, it was great. I am happy with it as long as it continues to work.",

A lot of stations charge or if they turn it on for free for you it doesn't last long and you keep having to go to them to turn it back on. My 2013 Kia Optima tends to lose air pressure easily when the weather is cold so this has given me a peace of mind knowing I have this in case.

It has a nice long air hose that is almost 20 inches and it is the screw type Schrader valve which I've been looking for. I have large hands and I am a Sr. Citizen. By the time I find the Schrader valve on the tire it's buried inside the fancy wheel rims that come with the SUV. So I prefer the screw on type as I lose less air than I do with the clip on type. I am not enamored with the clip on type which is using a plastic lock and I really question how long that will work and not break. This is why I bought this model versus the newer model that actually has 45LPM and it comes with a storage case for the same price as I paid for this model. The manufacturer claims 40 minutes continuous battery use which is more than enough to fill ~ 20 tires but that's based on smaller tire dimensions, usually they are quoting 16 or 17-in width tires versus my 19-in. Many of my retired friends feel the same way as it's much easier for us to deal with the screw on Schrader valve than it is the press on lock type hose fitting. If the new model had the screw on type I would have bought that as it would have saved me some money but that's how strongly I feel about having the screw on type air hose. With the reduced amperage on the battery it makes it much lighter and also smaller. I found the case that holds all the fittings in the air hose in a much smaller dimension case that easily fits into my Tucson or RAV 4 glove boxes. It has a bag to hold all the cords and attachments. It has strong air transfer claiming 4X faster air transfer which is the key thing. (Who needs four hours of continuous battery capacity?? At that point I'll pull out my small air compressor and get it all done < half that time)! I attached a photo of the new case versus the old case I procured for a different model that had a 25,000 aMh battery so that was the case that fit for that type of unit The display is bright and pretty intuitive settings on thev AP1001. I have updated my review to five stars for two reasons: I used this on a recent road trip to Oregon and California. I aired up my tires four times and the battery was still charged up enough to NOT be in the red. Also the customer service as mentioned by a few people is very good. I called to register this product for the warranty which is 18 months and they actually upgraded to 2 years which is one of the better warranties out there. CONS: the new model uses the press on type connector versus the screw on air hose. Plus the new model is the same price as the old model with better performance and an includes a storage case with it. It would also be nice to come with the cigarette lighter extension so you had dual power as many of the other competing models do but not that big of a deal to me.",

  Excelent product and support","Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024",,"Second follow up. Now upgraded to 5 stars. Reached out to Modari directly and ""Sonia"" from the company provided truly great customer service. I was given a choice of either a full refund or a new air hose. Since the device was fine otherwise, I opted for a new air hose. Sonia also took up the issue of relatively slow inflation times, took time to understand my issue and even offered to take my issue to their engineers for future improvements. The inflation time is based on a standard (smaller) tire and is realistic, in my opinion. My experience with a significantly larger tire makes sense. As I stated before, even considering the slower inflation time, the device still performed well and I still recommend it. Given the level of personal customer service provided, Modari has, in my humble opinion, earned 5 stars. Buy with confidence!
 

 This is a follow up on my initial four-star review, now down to one star. The air hose developed a leak after just a few weeks of use. Useless without the hose. Will try to get product support and modify my review to reflect at that time.
 

 Good value considering the price. Makes tire inflation relatively easy, compact package easy to take along on a trip. However, probably better for topping off tires rather than inflation after a flat. It took over 20 minutes and a full charge to inflate one of my Toyota FJ cruiser tires from 12 pounds to 38.

Seemed to do the job. I bought one of these compressors when I got home and put it through some tests. I have a Kubota L2501 tractor. Right front tire goes completely flat if it sits long enough. Used this device to inflate this tire. Took seven minutes and change to go from 0psi to 30psi. On my Harley, I used this device to ""tune"" the air pressure in both tires. It's handy to be able to screw this onto the stem and be able to see the psi in the tire. One tire was over inflated so I backed off the screw and let a little air out until the psi was below where I wanted it. Tightened the fitting, hit the start button, and the device filled my tire to my preset psi. Went to the CRV next and checked all four tires. Each was a little under where I wanted them. This little compressor made quick work of ensuring all four tires are properly maintained. I bought a second device and will keep it in the daily driver along with a tire repair kit.

 The preprogrammed inflation modes are a huge plus. Instead of guessing the right pressure, I just select the mode for cars, bikes, bicycles, or sports equipment.
 

 Another unexpected but welcome feature is the USB power output. This means the inflator can double as a power bank for charging a mobile phone in case of emergencies.

At that point I'll pull out my small air compressor and get it all done < half that time)! I attached a photo of the new case versus the old case I procured for a different model that had a 25,000 aMh battery so that was the case that fit for that type of unit The display is bright and pretty intuitive settings on thev AP1001. I have updated my review to five stars for two reasons: I used this on a recent road trip to Oregon and California. I aired up my tires four times and the battery was still charged up enough to NOT be in the red. Also the customer service as mentioned by a few people is very good. I called to register this product for the warranty which is 18 months and they actually upgraded to 2 years which is one of the better warranties out there. CONS: the new model uses the press on type connector versus the screw on air hose. Plus the new model is the same price as the old model with better performance and an includes a storage case with it. It would also be nice to come with the cigarette lighter extension so you had dual power as many of the other competing models do but not that big of a deal to me.",4 people found this helpful

 I also love that it's cordless — no more fumbling with wires or needing to be near a power outlet. The digital screen is clear, and the auto-stop feature when it hits the desired pressure is a nice touch. It’s compact enough to keep in the car without taking up much space.

 First off, it's compact and lightweight—about the size of a burrito, but far more satisfying. It fits snugly in my glove compartment, ready to spring into action whenever I need it.​
 

 The 160 PSI power is no joke. It inflated my car tire from 30 PSI to 36 PSI faster than I could finish humming the chorus of ""Pump Up the Jam."" I half-expected it to start beatboxing.​
 

 The digital display is clear and easy to read, even for someone like me who struggles to set the microwave clock. And the auto shut-off feature? A lifesaver. No more overinflated surprises.​
 

 But here's the kicker: it's not just for tires. I've used it to inflate basketballs, pool toys, and even a deflated air mattress during a camping trip. It's like the Swiss Army knife of air compressors.​

,Cynthia,5.0 out of 5 stars, 5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2019",,"I bought 2 of these pumps along with the cases recommended.
 

 My car tires were 27psi and I pumped them up to 32psi. (was a very cold day) I don't think I had the compressors charged enough. So, I only got 1 tire pumped up and had to recharge. These would be great if you had 1 low tire and needed to inflate to get somewhere. I'm impressed at the quality.
 

 Update: I found my 2nd Air Compressor, and it was fully charged. I pumped up 1 more tire 27psi to 32psi, but as soon as I began filling the tire, the battery light came on yellow, meaning, the battery was being used up really quick. It lasted 2 tires before I had to charge again. The nice thing about these, is you set the PSI or your measurements, screw on the compressor, then turn on, and it shows you the current pressure of the tire, and then you click on start and let it fill to your desired pressure. It shuts off automatically. It was snowy today so I could use these in the garage and stay warm.
 

 These get a little bit warm while filling but they are ok.
 

 Overall, I am very happy with these products. If it was me, I would keep 2 in the car all charged up just in case I needed extra filling to get somewhere.
 

 You can also charge these in the car- however, it takes longer to charge and would work best if you were on a long road trip. Basically, these worked well.",

,Samuel,5.0 out of 5 stars, 5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2017",,"I topped off 4 tires on a medium sized sedan, adding approximately 6 lb per tire.
 It filled the tires quite a bit faster than my defunct much larger portable air compressor from Lowe's. I didn't time it, but I would say it MAYBE took 10 minutes at the most. I started with a fully charged battery, and was approximately halfway through the battery when I was done. (yellow, which is anywhere from 70% to 30%) So you probably want to charge this after every use, so it's ready to go if you need to fill a whole tire. It is not super loud, but it is not particularly quiet, either. It gets QUITE warm during use, particularly the hose itself. My only real complaint would be that the battery indicator is green-yellow-red, rather than showing an actual battery percentage. Had that been an included feature, this would have made it to a 5-star review. As I am likely going to be charging it after every use anyway, that is not a deal killer, but a small detail they could have made better. Maybe that is available on the more expensive models they sell. It is small enough that it should fit in most glove compartments, which is nice. I cannot attest to it's durability over the long term, but I would recommended this for the use for which it was designed, which is ""emergency"" i.e., occasional use.

,Maria,5.0 out of 5 stars, 5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2021",,"When the temperature drops at night, one or more of my SUV tires will lose a little pressure, and the annoying tire light comes on. I have trouble seeing the tiny numbers on my tire gauge and using enough force to push and hold the gas station air hose on to fill the tires.
 

 Don't let the compact size fool you. This little device is magic. It's easy to see and read, even in the dark. It screws onto the tire valve (you don't have to press and hold), automatically checks the pressure, fills the tire to the pressure you entered, and then stops. For such a small device, it filled the tires within just a few minutes.
 

 It is easy to charge with the included USB cable and comes with a carrying bag to keep it in. I wish I had found it sooner.",

It won’t reach the back tires. This one is cordless and easy to carry. It charges up quickly. I tried it out on one of our cars that had a flat tire and it did get it inflated. But it took probably about 15 minutes. The little hose gets quite warm. I think it’s good enough to top off your tires if they get low or if you get a slow leak. It’ll save you from calling a tow and you will be able to get to the next tire shop to get it fixed. Pumping up 4 truck tires though will take a long time. And the thing is noisy.,

,Betty,5.0 out of 5 stars, 5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2019",,"Review PROS: Focus is on the amount of air being moved versus battery capacity. It added 3 PSI to all 4 of my my P235/55R19 tires for my hybrid Tucson in about 6 - 7 minutes total as the airflow is a fast 35 LPM. It has a nice long air hose that is almost 20 inches and it is the screw type Schrader valve which I've been looking for. I have large hands and I am a Sr. Citizen. By the time I find the Schrader valve on the tire it's buried inside the fancy wheel rims that come with the SUV. So I prefer the screw on type as I lose less air than I do with the clip on type. I am not enamored with the clip on type which is using a plastic lock and I really question how long that will work and not break. This is why I bought this model versus the newer model that actually has 45LPM and it comes with a storage case for the same price as I paid for this model. The manufacturer claims 40 minutes continuous battery use which is more than enough to fill ~ 20 tires but that's based on smaller tire dimensions, usually they are quoting 16 or 17-in width tires versus my 19-in. Many of my retired friends feel the same way as it's much easier for us to deal with the screw on Schrader valve than it is the press on lock type hose fitting. If the new model had the screw on type I would have bought that as it would have saved me some money but that's how strongly I feel about having the screw on type air hose. With the reduced amperage on the battery it makes it much lighter and also smaller. I found the case that holds all the fittings in the air hose in a much smaller dimension case that easily fits into my Tucson or RAV 4 glove boxes. It has a bag to hold all the cords and attachments. It has strong air transfer claiming 4X faster air transfer which is the key thing. (Who needs four hours of continuous battery capacity?? At that point I'll pull out my small air compressor and get it all done < half that time)! I attached a photo of the new case versus the old case I procured for a different model that had a 25,000 aMh battery so that was the case that fit for that type of unit The display is bright and pretty intuitive settings on thev AP1001. I have updated my review to five stars for two reasons: I used this on a recent road trip to Oregon and California. I aired up my tires four times and the battery was still charged up enough to NOT be in the red. Also the customer service as mentioned by a few people is very good. I called to register this product for the warranty which is 18 months and they actually upgraded to 2 years which is one of the better warranties out there. CONS: the new model uses the press on type connector versus the screw on air hose. Plus the new model is the same price as the old model with better performance and an includes a storage case with it. It would also be nice to come with the cigarette lighter extension so you had dual power as many of the other competing models do but not that big of a deal to me.",

,trumpet guy,5.0 out of 5 stars,,,,"I absolutely love this portable air compressor! It’s compact, lightweight, and incredibly powerful. I’ve used it for everything from inflating car tires to pumping up bike tires, and it works like a charm every time. The digital display is easy to read, and setting the desired pressure is a breeze—no more guessing or overinflating.
 

 It also comes with multiple adapters, so I can use it for a variety of tasks. The long power cord and air hose make it super convenient to reach all four tires without having to reposition the unit. I was amazed at how quickly it inflated my car tire; it only took a few minutes to get it back to the right pressure.
 

 The auto shut-off feature is a huge plus—it stops once it reaches the set pressure, which gives me peace of mind. It’s small enough to fit in my trunk without taking up too much space, so I always have it on hand for emergencies.
 

 Overall, this air compressor is a must-have for anyone who needs a reliable and portable solution. Highly recommend.",

 The different modes are preset to common inflation pressure standards for different uses ( ball vs bike vs car vs motorcycle) which can be adjusted manually. There is a manual mode preset to higher pressures.
 This is great for winter time tire pressure top offs when it feels like a pain to use the plugged versions for adjusting a few psi. I think it would do well in an emergency flat tire situation. Don't know how long the battery lasts yet, but you should easily be able to fill up a car tire from flat. It's not like the plugged versions have a long duty cycle anyway.
